            <p> Milano was founded in 2007, by Roger Hessing and Chef Paulo Nonino. They quit their 
                high paying jobs at The Ritz Carlton Hotels in Asia and the Middle East to follow their 
                passion, and came to Bangalore, India, to start their venture. Since this was their first
                 experience in India, they initially faced a challenge in understanding the Indian market 
                 conditions, given that the F&B industry was still in its nascent stages at the time.  </p>

            <p class="symbol"> &#10059; </p>
            <p> Since its inception in 2007, Milano has remained true to its motto and 
                vision – consistency in authenticity and quality of food, top notch service 
                of the highest standards, and utmost hospitality towards our patrons and guests. 
                We have shown consistent drive and focus towards achieving these high standards, 
                and our hard work has borne fruit in the form of numerous awards, recognitions 
                and success stories.  </p>

            <p> Our founding partners each come with over 20 years of rich hotel experience. They 
                started Milano with the same high standards of excellence, and have inculcated 
                hospitality as a habit amongst all our staff, old or new. Today, our teams still go
                 through rigorous training in the form of SOPs, training manuals, on-the-job trainings, 
                 refresher modules, and the like. They are trained to give “the wow experience” to all 
                 our guests, without discrimination.  </p>
